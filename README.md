# nonimmigrationdata-ETL-with-AWS-tools-Apache-Sparkg-and-Apache-Airflow
In the project, a data lake has been processed in order to create a SSOT and BI analytics database.

## Method

*All related information about the project was explained in `BigData_Review.ipynb` exhaustively.\
*In order to observe data which uploded a disc, `BigData_Review.ipynb` script has been processed.\
*The data addressed in the .ipynb file was sampled in `sample_data` file.\
*A sample query result of the created database was added in order to demostrate data pipeline runs properly via `query_result` parquet file. 

## Remark

*The original source of the nonimmigrand i94 data is available with paying. Thus a small part of the data added into repository in order to provide trail of the project.
*python 3, spark version 2.4 and airflow 1.10 can be used for the pipeline and code execution.
